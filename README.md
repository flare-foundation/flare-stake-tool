# Flare P-chain Staking Tool

This repo contains a tool for staking assets.

Because Flare is a fork of [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform), like Avalanche, it has three chains:

- C-chain: contract chain, executes EVM smart contracts that manage assets (like ERC-20 tokens).
- P-chain: platform chain, coordinates validators.
- X-chain: exchange chain, handles assets.

When validators require tokens to work (for example, as stake in proof-of-stake systems), these assets need to be moved from the C-chain to the P-chain.
This tool also supports moving assets between the C- and P-chains and back.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the tool. Unless you plan to contribute to this repository, We recommend using `npm` (version >= 16).

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @flarenetwork/flare-stake-tool --global
```

### Manually building the repository

For developers, first clone the repo with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-stake-tool.git
```
then run `yarn` and `yarn build` inside the cloned repo folder, and follow the rest of this guide from the repo folder using `bin/flare-stake-tool` instead of just `flare-stake-tool`.

## Setting up your environment

There are three ways to use this app:

1. With a connected ledger device,
1. With an initialized public key,
1. With a private key logged inside your environment file.

The ledger device requires no setup, as the needed public key is always extracted from the connected ledger device.

To initialize this app with your secp256k1 curve public key (a 32-byte hexadecimal prefixed `0x02`/`0x03` or a 64-byte hexadecimal optionally prefixed `0x04`), run the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool init-ctx -p <public key> --network <flare|costwo>
```

This allows the app to produce unsigned transaction hashes, which can be signed externally (using ECDSA), and then sent back to the app to finalize the transaction.

To use this app in a less-secure manner, you can set your private key as an environment variable. To do this, follow the below steps:
1. Obtain the private key (32 bytes either in hexadecimal or [cb58](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4587395-what-is-cb58) format).
1. Create a file to hold your private key.
1. Paste this code in as follows and enter either the private key in either hex or cb58 format within the quotation marks:

   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY_CB58="private key"
   PRIVATE_KEY_HEX="private key"
   ```

> **WARNING**
> While easier (as signing is done within the app), we discourage the usage of this app with the private key exposed in the file. This is because the private key is exposed to 800+ dependencies, and there is no way to audit them all.

## App usage with ledger

Below we describe the functionality offered by the app, when you have your ledger device connected to the computer, with avalanche app running.

> **IMPORTANT**
> The following commands assume you have the correct (development) version of ledger where applications not validated by ledger themselves can be run. In that case you need to install an unofficial Avalance app that allows you to clear-sign transactions.
Otherwise, you will need to blindly sign transactions as the ledger won't correctly parse the transaction details. To do this, add `--blind` to the end of each command.

### Address conversion

This describes how to view the P- and C-chain addresses. Those addresses are derived from your public key, which in turn can be derived from your private key.

```bash
flare-stake-tool addresses --ledger
```

Sample response:
```bash
P-chain address: P-flare1pynhfl09rfrf20s83lf6ra5egqylmx757ahxn6
C-chain address hex: 0xead9c93b79ae7c1591b1fb5323bd777e86e150d4
secp256k1 public key: 0x02efe41c5d213089cb7a9e808505e9084bb9eb2bf3aa8050ea92a5ae9e20e5a692
```

The P-chain address is in the Bech32 format, while the C-chain uses the Ethereum format to comply with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Lastly, the public key is in the standard compressed format.

### Check balances

This describes how to view your P- and C-chain balances.

```bash
flare-stake-tool balance --ledger
```

Sample response:
```bash
C-chain 0x5a6a8c28a2fc040df3b7490440c50f00099c957a: 999.000000000000000000 FLR
P-chain P-flare1mwy6yvuk8xjl87scxfvvl63xtex3ennvkkpasz: 1.000000000 FLR
```

### Export and import assets

#### Move assets from the C-chain to the P-chain

This describes how to move assets from the C-chain to the P-chain.

Funds typically reside on the C-chain account, so they have to be exported from it. Exported funds must then be imported to the corresponding P-chain account. This requires one transaction on each chain, so you need to issue two commands.

```bash
flare-stake-tool exportCP -a <amount> -f <fee> --ledger
flare-stake-tool importCP --ledger
```

Where:

- `amount` is the amount to export, in FLR.
- `fee` is optional. It specifies a gas fee for a transaction in FLR.

> **Note**
> Methods affecting the P-chain (`importCP` and `exportPC`) always use a fixed gas fee of 0.001FLR, while methods affecting the C-chain (`exportCP` and `importPC`) have variable gas fees and can thus be either set or calculated automatically.
If you get the `errInsufficientFunds` error, try specifying a higher gas fee when exporting funds.
The fee is not deducted from the exported amount, but from the C-chain account.
The final amount on the P-chain is therefore exactly the `amount` specified.

Sample response:
```bash
Transaction with hash 2Ch7Tp3mBxW4QZ57Lr26bddXf7QqNGrukRVbBgwSbrPWisuxYV sent to the node
```

#### Move assets from the P-chain back to the C-chain

> **IMPORTANT**
> These commands are similar to exporting and importing assets from the C-chain to the P-chain, but they are not the same.
Note the reversed P and C.

```bash
flare-stake-tool exportPC -a <amount> --ledger
flare-stake-tool importPC -f <fee> --ledger
```

where `amount` and `fee` are optional. If amount after `exportPC` is not specified, all funds are exported.

### Staking

To add a validator node to the flare network, run the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool stake -n <nodeId> -s <start-time> -e <end-time> -a <amount> --delegation-fee <delegation-fee> --ledger
```

Where:
- `nodeId` is the ID of the node being deployed as a validator.
- `start-time` is the unix time of the start of the staking process. We suggest you put this time a bit in the future (not use the current time), as the transaction must be confirmed before the staking process starts, otherwise it will revert.
- `end-time` is the unix time of the end of the staking process.
- `amount` is the amount to lock and stake in FLR.
- `delegation-fee` is the fee in percent that the validator charges for delegating to it. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 100.

When the staking period ends, the nodes automatically stop acting as validators and the staked amount is returned to the P-chain account.

To check whether a validator has been added successfully, fetch lists of both pending and current validators with this command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool info validators
```

### Delegating

To delegate to a validator node, run the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool delegate -n <nodeId> -s <start-time> -e <end-time> -a <amount> --ledger
```

Where:
- `nodeId` is the ID of the deployed validator node, you wish to delegate to.
- `start-time` is the unix time of the start of the delegation process.
- `end-time` is the unix time of the end of the delegation process.
- `amount` is the amount to lock and delegate in FLR.

## Operations with public key

The public key is needed to construct the unsigned transaction hashes, which can then be signed externally (e.g. through a hardware wallet or a custodial API) and sent back to the app to finalize the transaction.

Transation finalization thus requires three steps:
1. generate the unsigned transaction inside a json file and obtain the produced hash / message,
1. externally sign the hash and send the signature back to the app to finalize the export transaction,
1. finalize the transaction with the signature and send it to a network node.

The app-generated unsigned transaction json file respects the below format:

```json
{
  "transactionType": "",
  "serialization": "",
  "signatureRequests": [
    {
      "message": "",
      "signer": ""
    }, ...
  ],
  "unsignedTransactionBuffer": ""
}
```

> **Note**
> The messages and signers inside `signatureRequests` should all be the same, so only one signature is required.

The signed transaction json file that you should generate via raw signing is the same as unsigned, but with appended raw `message` signature. So, it respects the below format:

```json
{
  "transactionType": "",
  "serialization": "",
  "signatureRequests": [
    {
      "message": "",
      "signer": ""
    }, ...
  ],
  "unsignedTransactionBuffer": "",
  "signature": ""
}
```

An example signature is of the `r|s|v` format, e.g. `98f8c0d13bf2b5a5b2216894e503a721a099a1944116b802f2d84c0bd83a1bef3378e1b56d7ccd06de321913b8db0e97f4775e1885c86f6bcc583330d37cf5be01` where the last byte `v` is the recovery ID and can be either `00`/`01` or `1b`/`1c`.

Unsigned transaction files are always in the form of `${id}.unsignedTx.json` and signed transaction files are always in the form of `${id}.signedTx.json`. To send a signed transaction named `${id}.signedTx.json`, use the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool send -i <transaction-id>
```

### Move assets from the C-chain to the P-chain

Commands for obtaining unsigned transactions are the same as for the ledger in previous section, except that you ommit the `--ledger` flag and additionally have to specify transaction id `-i <transaction-id>`. For example:
```bash
flare-stake-tool exportCP -a <amount> -i <transaction-id>
```

## Operations with private key

To use the app with the private key, you can copy the commands used with ledger and replace `--ledger` flag with `--get-hacked` and add an additional argument `--env-path <path to your private key file>`. For example:

```bash
flare-stake-tool exportCP -a <amount> -i <transaction-id> --env-path <path to your private key file> --get-hacked
```

## Interactive CLI

For easier guidance through the process, you can also use an interactive CLI, with the following command:

```bash
flare-stake-tool interactive
```

## Validation and misc operations

### Getting your node ID:

```bash
curl -s -X POST --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id" :1, "method" :"info.getNodeID" }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' RPC-URL:PORT/ext/info
```

### Check the pending validators (To see if the stake or delegation was successful):

```bash
curl -s --location --request POST 'RPC-URL:PORT/ext/bc/P' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0",     "method": "platform.getPendingValidators",     "params": {         "subnetID": null,         "nodeIDs": []     },     "id": 1 }' | jq .
```

## Tests

1. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
1. Create an `.env` with following content:
    ```text
    PRIVATE_KEY_HEX = "88b3cf6b7e9ef18a508209d61311a376bde77be5d069449b1eace71130f8252c"
    PUBLIC_KEY = "04423fb5371af0e80750a6481bf9b4adcf2cde38786c4e613855b4f629f8c45ded6720e3335d1110c112c6d1c17fcbb23b9acc29ae5750a27637d385991af15190"
    ```
1. Create a `ctx.json` with the following content:
    ```text
    {
      "publicKey": "04423fb5371af0e80750a6481bf9b4adcf2cde38786c4e613855b4f629f8c45ded6720e3335d1110c112c6d1c17fcbb23b9acc29ae5750a27637d385991af15190",
      "network": "localflare"
    }
    ```
1. Run the docker conatiner via `docker-compose up -d`
1. Go to `test/helper` and run `node queryChain`. It will generate output similar to this (note that it may vary):
    ```text
    assetId: HK58c7FvFK79cbFsdFf1qVL5bVwQcCRkzZN5Ked8uZsyheeEN
    blockchainId for X-chain: ecxi7p3JMYsx6abaYt7b9YiGbj6okQUs8QpqSxMKsFwEioff1
    blockchainId for C-chain: 2PyHrN5q8uF7tFLHsiCmG7tmkFWMDjikuYJgnHAXV83o8wMTFD
    blockchainId for P-chain: 11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY
    ```
1. Now go to `node_modules/@flarenetwork/flarejs/dist/utils/constants.js` and make changes for the P-chain, C-chain, X-chain and assetId in the following places:
![image info](test/images/img1.png)

    a. Replace avaxAssetId with the assetId

    b. Replace blockchainId in n6x with X-chain id

    c. Replace blockchainId in n6c with C-chain id

    Similarly, for the following part:
    ![image info](test/images/img2.png)

    a. Replace the key for n6x with X-chain id

    b. Replace the key for n6c with C-chain id

1. Run `yarn run coverage` to generate the coverage report
1. As we were facing issue with ledger, so we have created separate command to run the testcases:

    a. For `ledger/sign` - `yarn run ledger-sign-testcase`

    b. For `ledger/key` - `yarn run ledger-key-testcase`

    c. For `ledger/utils` - `yarn run ledger-utils-testcase`

    d. For `cli` - `yarn run cli-testcase`
